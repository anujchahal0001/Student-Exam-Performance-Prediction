# Student-Exam-Performance-Prediction
Student Exam Performance Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to forecast a student’s final exam score based on various influencing factors.
By analyzing patterns in past data, this project helps in understanding what contributes to academic success and where interventions may be needed.

🧠 Objectives:
Predict a student's final exam score using key features like:

Hours studied per week

Previous exam scores

Attendance rate

Identify students at academic risk

Provide insights for educators to improve learning outcomes

📊 Data Used:
The dataset includes features such as:

Study_Hours_per_Week

Past_Exam_Scores

Attendance_Rate

Final_Exam_Score (Target Variable)

Data Source:
Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset

🔍 Techniques Used:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand relationships

Data Preprocessing including handling missing values, normalization, etc.

Linear Regression Model for predicting continuous scores

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

📈 Insights:
Attendance and past scores show strong correlation with final results.

Students who study consistently perform better on average.

Regression models provide fairly accurate predictions with room for improvement using advanced techniques.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn for modeling

Streamlit for model deployment (optional)

✅ Applications:
Early identification of struggling students

Personalized study plans based on data insights

Improved academic planning and resource allocation
